# Materia Client Assets

## This repository is now deprecated. No additional commits to this repo are expected.

As of Materia v10.0.0, all static assets - JS and CSS - have been re-authored and re-integrated into the main repository. This repository will persist, but only for archival purposes.

This repository contains all the javascript and css needed for the Materia Server and some assets needed for the Materia Widget Development Kit.

# Conventions and Guidelines

## Angular

* Each module is in it's own file, in a directory matching the type of module it is
* use dashes to seperate words in file names
* tests use the same name of the module they are testing (`module.js` and `module.test.js`)
* file names start with the type of module it is: `filter-`, `dir-`, `ctrl-`, `srv-`
* reusable code that has a wider scope then a single module is placed in a service module


### Order of Code Angular Controllers

By convention, all controllers are written in a certain order from top to bottom:

1. Variables and constants used in the controller
2. Function defenitions, do define directly on $scope
3. Expose variables and methods to $scope
4. Initialize state


```javascript
const app = angular.module('materia')
app.controller('peopleController', function($scope) {
	// define vars and consts
	let _people = []

	// define functions
	const _sortNames = (a, b) => `${a.first} ${a.last}`.localeCompare(`${b.first} ${b.last}`)

	const getPeople () => {
		// load users from some place
		_people.sort(_sortNames)
		$scope.people = _people
	}

	// Expose on scope
	$scope.people = []
	$scope.getPeople = getPeople

	// initialize
	getPeople()
})
```
